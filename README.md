Python vs cpp:
* pass by reference vs pass by value (hit_record)



Chap6 anti-aliasing
* separate `camera` class
* significantly slower, had to set anti-aliasing factor to 10 instead of 100 in cpp

Chap7 diffuse
* do not emit light
* take environment light + own intrinsic color
* random reflection
* recursive diffuse
* gamma correction
